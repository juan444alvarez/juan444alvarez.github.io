                <p>As part of the UX design process, I conducted a user research phase to gather insights and identify pain points with the existing web app. To supplement my own observations, I leveraged user reviews as a primary source of user input. By analyzing and synthesizing these reviews, I  aimed to corroborate my own findings and ensure a user-centric approach to the digital design.</p>

                    <h3>USER FLOW</h3>
                    <p>Keeping user pain points in mind, I mapped out an initial flow using some of the initial framework and removing redundancies. Since this would be its own app, I removed the need to search through the park web app for the shuttle section. This set up an easier journey towards a ticket with less touchpoints and more meaningful interactions.

                    <p>Now that I knew which screens were required, I shifted my focus towards the main components that users would interact with. To enable modular reusability and efficient editing of the design, I used Figma's component properties feature during the design process. Starting from atoms, I built responsive tabs, sliders, buttons, and a calendar that would take user inputs through selection or text. Using this process also ensures the design is optimized for a smooth developer handoff.</p>

                <p>Putting together an app like this was a lot of fun since I worked on solving my own personal issues I and the same many others experienced. If you’d like to check out the full app and its animations & interactions, here’s a link to the  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ylfUpGM8sjGVkEMnhYX95t/Zion-Canyon-Mobile?node-id=439%3A10812&t=tO1e8QFC3SmebYZc-1" target="_blank" data-value="prototype.">prototype.</a></p>
                <p>I think I was able to solidify a better shuttle app core experience to accompany  the transportation systems already high value proposition. I focused on the ticketing selection and adding some friction through a checkout/verification process and loading animations, but there are still other directions to update and build upon.</p>
                <ul class="insights-ul">
                    <li>Test my flow with users, and iterate based on feedback.</li>
                    <li>Solidify the app's architecture as a whole park experience since I only designed a specific flow.</li>
                    <li>Design an onboarding flow to explain ticket buying process.</li>
                    <li>Design a waiting room feature if ticket sellout times are still fast.</li>
                    <li>Systematize my designs further.</li>
